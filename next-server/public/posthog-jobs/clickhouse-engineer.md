## **About PostHog**

We help developers build successful products by giving them a suite of products to analyze, test, observe, and deploy new features. We currently offer product and web analytics, session replay, feature flags, A/B testing, a CDP, SQL access, and a data warehouse‚Ä¶ and [there‚Äôs plenty more to come](https://posthog.com/roadmap).

PostHog was created as an open-source project during Y Combinator's W20 cohort. We had the most successful B2B software launch on HackerNews since 2012 with a product that was just 4 weeks old. Since then, more than 110,000 companies have installed the platform. We've had huge success with our paid upgrades, raised $27m from some of the world's top [investors](https://posthog.com/handbook/strategy/investors), and have shown strong product-led growth ‚Äì 97% driven by word of mouth.

We're growing quickly, but sustainably. We're [also default alive](http://www.paulgraham.com/aord.html), averaging 10% monthly revenue growth and with more than $10m ARR. We're staying focused on building an awesome product for end users, hiring a handful of exceptional team members, and seeing fantastic growth as a result.

### **What we value**

- We are [open source](https://posthog.com/handbook/company/values#we-are-open-source) \- building a huge community around a free-for-life product is key to PostHog's strategy.

- We aim to become _the_ most transparent company, ever. In order to enable teams to make great decisions, we share as much information as we can. In our [public handbook](https://posthog.com/handbook) _everyone_ can read about our roadmap, how we pay (or even let go of) people, what our strategy is, and who we have raised money from.

- Working autonomously and maximizing impact - we don‚Äôt tell anyone what to do. Everyone chooses what to work on next based on what is going to have the biggest impact on our customers.

- Solve big problems - [we haven't built our defining feature yet](https://posthog.com/handbook/company/values#we-havent-built-our-defining-feature-yet). We are all about shipping fast, talking to users, and iterating.


## **Who we‚Äôre looking for**

The Clickhouse team is responsible for the Clickhouse cluster and query layer that all other teams (and all customers) use to store and query data. You‚Äôll help manage and operate the cluster, figure out the best architecture, and make it üöÄ

## **What you‚Äôll be doing**

- Develop tooling for full and incremental backup and restore processes for ClickHouse clusters.

- Create schema and mutation management tools to make it easy for teams at PostHog to manage their own tables.

- Enhance visibility into cluster statuses.

- Automate dynamic provisioning of instances, utilizing Terraform and Ansible.

- Build query benchmarking and performance tooling to help engineers in identifying and optimize expensive queries.

- Make everything‚Äîschema, queries, and cluster configurations‚Äîfaster and more efficient.


## **Requirements**

- Proficiency in Python, Kubernetes, and AWS.

- Experience building and operating high-scale complex data storage solutions

- Strong interest and experience in ClickHouse (or similar OLAP databases) internals and query performance optimization.

- Can thrive in a culture of autonomy and self-direction.


_Nice to have_

- Experience with Terraform and Ansible for infrastructure automation.


_We believe people from diverse backgrounds, with different identities and experiences, make our product and our company better. That‚Äôs why we dedicated a page in our handbook to_ [_diversity and inclusion_](https://posthog.com/handbook/company/diversity) _. No matter your background, we'd love to hear from you! Alignment with our values is just as important as experience! üôè_

_Also, if you have a disability, please let us know if there's any way we can make the interview process better for you - we're happy to accommodate!_

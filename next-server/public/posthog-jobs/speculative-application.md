Speculative application

Team People & Ops

# Speculative application

- #### Location


**Remote (US)**


We take exceptional people when they come along - and we really mean that!

**Don’t see a specific role listed?** That doesn't mean we won't have a spot for you. Send us a speculative application and let us know how you think you could contribute to PostHog.

We take applications seriously - you won't just end up in a candidate database. We make quick decisions, and if the timing isn’t quite right, we’ll do our best to provide insight into a better time to apply.

Regardless of the timing of your application or interest in PostHog, you can go ahead and contribute to one of our [**good first issues**](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22).

## **About PostHog**

PostHog helps engineers build better products. We are a single platform to analyze, test, observe, and deploy new features. We give engineers product & web analytics, session replay, feature flags, experiments, a CDP, SQL access, and a data warehouse… and there’s plenty more to come.

PostHog was created as an open-source project during Y Combinator's W20 cohort and had the most successful B2B software launch on HackerNews since 2012 - with a product that was just 4 weeks old. Since then, more than 70,000 companies have installed the platform. We've had huge success with our paid upgrades, raised $27m from some of the world's top [investors](https://posthog.com/handbook/strategy/investors), and have shown strong product-led growth - 97% driven by word of mouth.

We're growing quickly but sustainably - we're [default alive](http://www.paulgraham.com/aord.html), averaging 10% monthly revenue growth, with >$10m ARR. We're staying focused on building an awesome product for end users, hiring a handful of exceptional team members, and seeing fantastic growth as a result.

### **What we value**

- We are [open source](https://posthog.com/handbook/company/values#we-are-open-source) \- building a huge community around a free-for-life product is key to PostHog's strategy.

- We aim to become _the_ most transparent company, ever. In order to enable teams to make great decisions, we share as much information as we can. In our [public handbook](https://posthog.com/handbook) _everyone_ can read about our roadmap, how we pay (or even let go of) people, what our strategy is, and who we have raised money from. We also have regular team-wide feedback sessions, where we share honest feedback with each other.

- Working autonomously and maximizing impact - we don’t tell anyone what to do. Everyone chooses what to work on next based on what is going to have the biggest impact on our customers.


Solve big problems - [we haven't built our defining feature yet](https://posthog.com/handbook/company/values#we-havent-built-our-defining-feature-yet). We are all about acting fast, innovating, and [iterating](https://posthog.com/handbook/company/culture#iteration).

### **About our engineering teams**

- Engineers work across one of our small teams. Our main product-focused engineering teams are [Feature Success](https://posthog.com/handbook/small-teams/feature-success), [Product Analytics](https://posthog.com/handbook/small-teams/product-analytics) [,](https://posthog.com/handbook/people/team-structure/team-structure) [Replay](https://posthog.com/handbook/small-teams/session-recording), [Data Warehouse](https://posthog.com/handbook/small-teams/data-warehouse), [Web Analytics](https://posthog.com/handbook/small-teams/web-analytics), [Pipeline,](https://posthog.com/handbook/small-teams/pipeline) and [Infrastructure](https://posthog.com/handbook/small-teams/infrastructure). We usually consider hiring for all teams and then decide where individual people will work the best. We also give people the opportunity to move across teams, to make sure they get to work on different problems and learn new skills.

- We work on a two-week sprint basis and we give everyone in the team the opportunity to suggest what they want to build, in order to have the biggest impact on our customers. Engineers are given real ownership of what they want to focus on, and they are responsible for tests, user feedback, and tracking.

- You will be working directly with our customers - we have a weekly [support hero](https://posthog.com/handbook/engineering/support-hero#1-support-hero), who is in charge of all customer questions and inquiries that week. We also have a thriving user Slack group and we receive PRs from users every week.

- The technical challenge is designing a highly scalable product right out of the box when deployed on-premise, supporting a wide breadth of features that give users superpowers, and enabling an ecosystem of contributors and apps from anyone in the world.


## **Requirements**

- You'll have full-stack experience with relevant [technologies](https://posthog.com/handbook/engineering/stack) (Python or similar, React or similar, something to do with big data is a bonus)

- You have started a project from scratch. You might have led a project, been a founder previously, or built an impressive side project.

- You have strong communication skills. [We document everything](https://posthog.com/handbook/company/culture#write-stuff-down), most of it publicly.

- You move fast, have a strong bias for impact and you don’t shy away from [stepping on toes](https://posthog.com/handbook/company/values#tread-on-toes).


## _Nice to have_

- You've worked in a high-growth SaaS company

- Extensive experience with Django and/or TypeScript-based React


_If you have a disability, please let us know if there's any way we can make the interview process better for you - we're happy to accommodate!_
